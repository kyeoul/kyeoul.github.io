                <h1>My name is Jay Park.</h1>
                <h4>A computer scientist. A frontend developer. An eternal student.</h4>
                <h4>This is my story.</h4>
                <p>
                    I am a Northwestern University student currently studying Computer Science at Northwestern's McCormick School of Engineering.
                    After happening upon an opportunity to design UI layouts for a hackathon project, I have since dedicated myself to learning frontend
                    development as well as computer programming as my career of choice.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I am currently involved in NU Fintech as a core developer, as well as Leva, a Garage resident startup for workplace mentorship, as a
                    software developer. My relevant classworks include the Fundamentals of Computer Programming sequence, as well as Data Structures and Algorithms,
                    Intro to Computer Systems, and Intro to Human Computer Interaction.
                </p>

                <p>I strive to be a distinguished software developer that can contribute to any team that I find myself in. </p>
